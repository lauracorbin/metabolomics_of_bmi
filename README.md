Repo containing code used in the publication: 

"A multi-variant recall-by-genotype study of the metabolomic signature of BMI" published in Obesity (DOI: 10.1002/oby.23441).

This study used data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (application number B3194).

Scripts 01 & 02 were run in Stata14. These scripts have been edited to remove path names. 

All other scripts were run in R version 4.0.2 (2020-06-22). To aid reproducibility, for each script there is a corresponding 'sessioninfo' text file that contains details of the loaded packages and their version numbers. 

The first commit represents code as it was when the paper was accepted for publication in Obesity in March 2022.
